Data Dashboard Project

Purpose:
I wanted to do a dashboard since dashboards are quite important tools at the company I worked for.  I think that it is quite usefull to be able to 
create dashboards.

Planning & Implementation:
I went to Kaggle.com for my data.  I downloaded the CSV file of the avocado data from their free dataset for the data used in my dashboard.


Code Validation:
I tested my code for errors using Jshint.com.  Each HTML page of the site was run through the W3C markup validation Service and the CSS was run through 
the W3C css validation Service.


Project Deployment:
The project was deployed using GitHub and is published here:   https://tribannister.github.io/avocado/
